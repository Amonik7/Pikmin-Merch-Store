        <p>1. The second button's number in position.</p>
        <p>2. The amount to the left that is on the right of the button you pressed.</p>
        <p>3. The second rightmost button (Don't press it unless the button on the right said 0!) and as much to the left as the button on the right told you to last press.</p>
        <p>4. The button that has the number the button you pressed first had back then.</p>
        <p>5. The position as a number that the button labeled 7 is in! For example, if the button is in position 0, press the button labeled 0!</p>
        <p>6. The two numbers you pressed last subtracted from one another as the number. If the result is negative, do it the other way around!</p>
        <p>7. The trick for this one is that you hover over the button in the right position, then move your mouse pointer leftward as much as the button on its left tells you to!</p>
        <p>8. You are allowed to look it up this time. Level 4, press 6</p>
