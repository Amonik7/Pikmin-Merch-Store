    Now, please... Do this before they catch you! I don't wanna be stuck here forever!
    <small><small><small><small><small>DO THE FOLLOWING CODE TO LET ALL PRISONERS IN THE CODE ESCAPE (not that we recommend that, dear employee): 2.1.1.1.3, 4.3.2.1.5, 2.2.2.2.2, 1.2.3.1.2, 6.3.3.3.3, 4.2.6.1.2, 1.4.4.2.1</small></small></small></small></small>
    <br>Of one number chain, the first number is just for show (I think, you should still write it down). The second number is the category number, the third number is the item, the fourth is the button you need to press and the fifth is the amount!<br>
    To go back to the store and input the code to free yourself AND me (aka erase the store forever) from it, click <a href="fakeStorepage.html">here.</a><br>My advice is to write the code down and write down what every number means.
